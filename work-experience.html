<h3>4. <u>Animator and Video Editor at University Student Department</u></h3>

As an Animator, I have worked on various 3D animation Softwares but mainly upon MAYA. I also worked with  
Maya Embedded Language and the Python support PyMEL for various particle and object dynamics.

Following a Standard Pipeline, I have been part of  Object Modelling (Nurbs,Polygons etc);
Texturing, Lighting , Animation and Rendering(using mainly third party renderers).
I also credited Computer Graphics course to complement my aforementioned skills.

As a Video Editor I have extensive experience with Adobe Premier Pro, Adobe After Effects and Video Compression Process.
As, soon as H264 gained its popularity, we also introduced it as a standard for compressing Raw videos throughout the University. 
In the process I have experimented with various non-proprietary video codecs  and thus, have evolved deep interst in to Video Processing.
