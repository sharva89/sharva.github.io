  <h3> 1. &nbsp;<u>Automation of Vertical Blanking Interval</u></span></span></h3>


<p>The project was my six month internship at Broad India Pvt Ltd at Bangalore.
The Project was complete under the mentorship of Mr. Gurunath Kulkarni and under the supervision of Mr. Ravi Bhaskaran.
you can read more about&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_blanking_interval" target="_blank">
Vertical Blanking Interval here</a>. The project involved hours of geeky experimentation with Gage Card 
and Oscilloscopes. Once the signals were digitally captured it was stored in MATLAB . 
I made an algorithm to recognize the specific vsync and Hsyncs and then wrote separate algorithms
for each kind of VBI. I cant share all the codes because of Broadcom's propriety guidelines.
Still, I had prepared a report to beevaluated and &nbsp;submitted in my university. 
I have described &nbsp;VBI SIgnals, Gage Capture Card , My first line detection algorithm 
and the code for GUI in PERL. You can download the report here

<h3>2. <u>Intelligent Cardiac Monitoring System</u></h3>
<p></p>The paper has been published in International Journal of Online Engineering (ISSN: 1861-2121) in its Virtual Instrumentation issue Vol-7 ,No3(2011).
<a href="http://online-journals.org/i-joe/article/view/1541" target="_blank">
paper at online journal IJOE</a>&nbsp;.You can read the full text by downloading our paper here &nbsp;
<a href="http://files.sharva.webnode.in/200000002-998b99a8bb/1541-6046-1-PB.pdf">Intelligent Cardiac Monitoring.pdf (820247)</a></p>

The project developed a cheap and portable device for heart patients to keep track of heart rhythm.
The project is based on Atmega 32 microcontroller, hardware filters & Programmable Systems on Chip coupled with microphone to acquire the heart sound signals. In case of anomaly, the device 
is able to warn the user to get required medical help. It also saves the data for future diagnosis. 
The paper published also contains FFT analysis of normal heart signals and how the abnormal data will show a shift in the frequency.
A databse of various diseases in terms of frequancy was recommended for subsequent group of students who took the project.

<h3>3. <u>Reverse Solar Refrigeration</u></h3>
<p>&nbsp;It has been developed with the objective to help deliver vaccines to regions of the 
world without electricity or with inadequate electrical supply. A combined cycle of heating and cooling was envisioned through
adsorption on charcal with the help of mehanol working directly on solar panels, hence, bypassing the use of conventional
lead batteries and kerosene refrigerators.The proposed prototype is a versatile refrigeration technology that is environment-friendly,
battery-free, technologically-reliable and affordable. The project won second prize in the BITS Pilani Technical Meet-&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.bits-apogee.org/" target="_blank">APOGEE</a>&nbsp;2008. It then went on to be selected in the 
first round of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kvpy.org.in/main/index.htm" target="_blank">KVPY(Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan 
Yojana)</a>&nbsp;in the Stream SB( for undergraduates) category. You can read the full report here&nbsp;

<h3>4. <u>House Temperature Controller</u></h3>
<p>The Project aims to simulate a house temperature controller using different kinds of discontinuous controllers.
The backend has been made by using MATLAB's SIMULINK and then the GUI was made to take the inputs from the user.
I have lost the source code of the program but I had added the main parts in the pdf version of report .

<h3>5. <u>Intel 8086 Microprocessor based Function Generator </u></h3>
<p>This system is used to generate a Sine/ Triangular/ Square waveform of Frequencies 
ranging from 10 Hz to 99 KHz. Voltage is between 0-10V. The hardware used and the assembly level programming
is included in the reports &nbsp;

<h3>6. <u>OpenGL based Devanagiri Script Character Writer</u></h3>
<p>OpenGL based Devanagiri Script Character Writer was made as per partial fulfillment of course Computer Graphics. 
Open Graphics Library was used in Visual Basic to perform 
writing operation for some of the Devanagiri Characters. The algorithm was then optimized for faster operation</p>
